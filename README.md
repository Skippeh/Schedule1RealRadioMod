# Real Radio

> A radio plugin for Schedule I using BepInEx

**Note: Only works on demo version of the game until the game (hopefully) stops using il2cpp.**

Currently in development. Will improve readme at some point.

In short, the mod allows you to listen to real internet radio channels with positional audio and other features.
