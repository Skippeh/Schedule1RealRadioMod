# Unity Project for Schedule One

All script methods/etc have been stripped, but scriptable objects and prefabs etc still work fine at runtime if loaded with a mod loader like BepInEx or MelonLoader.

Only works with Unity Editor version 2022.3.32.

**Before opening the project you need to copy dependencies from the game's Managed folder. Make sure you're on the alternate branch on Steam, otherwise they'll be missing (alternate branch uses Mono, main branch uses IL2CPP).**

**DONT copy all files from the game's Managed folder**, just the ones that have a meta file in the `Assets/Plugins/ScheduleOne` folder.
